boston-ember2
=============

Building the BostonEmber app by [Brian Cardarella](https://github.com/bcardarella) using Ember-CLI on the Frontend and Rails on the Backend.
For this one I stuck to the orignial JavaScript/Handlebars languages provided in the [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) executable.
Cf. [tutorial](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/07/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-1.html)

To clone this repository and make it work, you should run the following commands:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/paulld/ember-cli.git
cd ember-cli
npm install
bower install
```
Launch the server on [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200):
```
ember server
```
